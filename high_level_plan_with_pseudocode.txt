Okay, let's develop a detailed high-level plan and pseudocode for replicating "In-Context Reinforcement Learning with Algorithm Distillation," focusing on clarity, formal notation, and practical implementation details. We'll keep computational constraints and time limitations in mind.

**High-Level Plan (Detailed)**

1.  **Project Setup & Environment Configuration:**
    *   **Action:** Set up a Python 3.8+ virtual environment. Install libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and other required libraries (`tqdm`, for example).
    *   **Tools:** `venv` or `conda`, `pip`
    *   **Resources:** Access to a GPU, if possible. We will aim to make the project executable on CPU, however the large models might need a high-end GPU.

2.  **Environment Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the required environments (Adversarial Bandit, Dark Room, Dark Key-to-Door, DMLab Watermaze) as defined in the paper. This may involve adapting existing code, or building them from scratch, paying close attention to make sure the tasks, observations, actions, rewards etc are correctly and faithfully implemented as they are in the paper.
    *   **Tools:** `numpy`, `gym` (or custom environment implementations using PyTorch).

3.  **Source RL Algorithm Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the source RL algorithms (UCB, A3C, DQN) in a way that we can extract the learning histories easily. The algorithms have to be carefully implemented using the specifications provided by the authors in the appendices.
    *   **Tools:** `torch`, custom Python code.

4.  **Data Generation:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   For each environment, train a source RL algorithm (with N independent agents) on the training tasks, and record all state-action-reward tuples from each run into a training history, such that a single learning history spans multiple episodes of the same task for the agent.
        *   Use appropriate sampling techniques to make sure that the created learning histories are similar to what is described in the paper.
        *   Store the learning histories in a suitable format (e.g., as a list of tuples).
    *   **Tools:** Custom Python code

5.  **Model Implementation (Transformer):**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement the causal transformer model using PyTorch's `transformers` library (or implement it from scratch using `torch.nn`).
        *   Implement tokenization for state-action-reward triplets.
        * Implement a forward pass that outputs the probability distribution over the action space, using all previous state-action-reward triplets in its context.
        *   Ensure the transformer attends to all previous tokens in each episode and can generate actions autoregressively.
    *   **Tools:** `torch.nn`, `transformers`

6.  **Model Training:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Create a training loop that samples subsequences from the learning histories.
        *   Pass the history subsequences through the causal transformer to predict the next action.
        *   Calculate the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss using the chosen action as the target.
        *   Perform backpropagation with Adam optimizer.
        *   Optionally implement label smoothing.
    *   **Tools:** `torch.optim`, `torch.autograd`, `torch.nn.functional`

7.  **Evaluation:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Implement a function to evaluate the model in-context, without any weight updates. During evaluation, use a similar approach to that in training by filling context with the triplets generated by model’s previous actions.
        *  Measure metrics such as episodic return.
         * Compare AD performance with baselines (ED, source algorithm, RL2 when relevant) in each environment.
         * Include all analysis from the paper including the performance of models with and without demonstartions, model trained with a different number of tasks, varying degrees of random masking.
        *   Ensure you are evaluating over multiple episodes.

    *   **Tools:** Custom Python code, `numpy`

8.  **Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Perform ablation studies to evaluate the individual contributions of the various components such as embedding size, layer count, attention, triplet reasoning.
        *    Test the model with different masking techniques.
        * Evaluate with different variations of the source RL algorithm.
    *  **Tools**: Custom code and functions.
9. **Robustness Testing:**
    * **Action**: Evaluate performance under different hyper parameters, as well as with minor variations in the implementation.
    *  **Tools**: Custom code

10. **Bias Detection and Mitigation:**
    *   **Action:** Analyze the training data, algorithm, and models for any potential sources of bias. Check for specific performance variation across tasks. Implement any mitigation strategies if appropriate.
    *  **Tools**: Custom code.

11. **Post-Processing and Documentation**
    * **Action**: Document all results, decisions, and limitations of the study in a clear and concise way. Perform a final check for all assumptions and limitations.
    * **Tools**: Custom text files.

**Pseudocode with Formal Notation**

Here's the pseudocode with more formal notation, focusing on the core steps of the Algorithm Distillation method:

**Notation:**

*   `M`: A task (e.g., a specific goal location in Dark Room).
*   `P_source`:  A source RL algorithm (e.g., UCB, A3C, DQN).
*  `H(M)_T`:  Learning history (a sequence of (o, a, r) tuples) generated by `P_source`  on task `M` up to time step `T`:  `H(M)_T = [(o_0, a_0, r_0), (o_1, a_1, r_1), ..., (o_T, a_T, r_T)]`
*  `D` : the dataset that consists of many such learning histories from different tasks: `D = [H(M_1)_T, H(M_2)_T, ..., H(M_N)_T]`
*  `h_t`: A learning history up to time step `t` (a subsequence of `H`): `h_t = [(o_0, a_0, r_0), (o_1, a_1, r_1), ..., (o_t-1, a_t-1, r_t-1), o_t]`
*  `P_`: A causal transformer with parameters 
*   `L_nll(a_t | h_t)`: Negative log likelihood loss (NLL) for predicting action `a_t` given history `h_t`
*  `O`: Observation Space.
*   `A`: Action Space.
*   `R`: Reward Space.
